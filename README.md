# Arcade Stacker

To play, press the spacebar to try and repeatedly stop the red square in the middle. After every row, the square becomes increasingly faster.
Personally my highscore is 14 :)

This is a personal project that utilizes the curses, time, and keyboard module.
I became much more comfortable with the curses module after this project and it was fun learning how to use the keyboard module.
